                THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY,
                instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
                Agreement. &nbsp;Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than
                rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. &nbsp;In the event any
                litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or
                enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead
                electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</span></p>

                therewith,
                shall be strictly confidential. &nbsp;The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise
                required by law. &nbsp;This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any
                information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive

                asserted. &nbsp;Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration
                Agreement.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">(l) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement
                will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. &nbsp;</span></p>

                to
                maintain the status quo pending arbitration. &nbsp;A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a
                waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</span></p>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">(p) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Courts. &nbsp; In any circumstances where the
                foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to
